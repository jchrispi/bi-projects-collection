# Joenor Chris Pineda - Data Analyst Portfolio
## About
Hi, I'm Chris! I have a degree in Information Technology. I am currently an all around data specialist in a Manufacturing Company doing database admin and data analyst task using SQL and Power BI.

During my work experience, I hone my ability to work with different complex data in Finance, Human Resource and Manufacturing and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience using ETL processes using different data sources like API's, web scraping and SQL.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. I am now exploring python specifically libraries for data analysis and machine learning that I would use in the future.

This is a repository to showcase skills and detailed projects I encounter in Data Analytics.

# Projects
In this section I will list data analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack used to solve cases.
